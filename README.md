# Eye-Exercise
## Description
The goal of this exercise is to create two eyes that follow the direction of the mouse as it moves across the screen.

## Future Improvements
One improvement that could be made is to 'cross the eyes' when the mouse is between the eyes. Another improvement would be to add a pupil and iris to each eye, and dilate and constrict the pupils based on the distance between the eyes and the mouse.
